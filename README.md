Gexc is a ripple-protocol-based financial network to promote and develop the fastest and least expensive payment settlements systems on a global scale. It enables payments in all types of currency as easy as sending email.

As the core component of the Gexc network, the underlying Gexc is a series of servers that run peer to peer software. Anyone can freely set up a Gexcd server to being accepting or receiving payments. Gexc network introduces a second native currency 'HDU' which is designed to promote the spread and adoption of the Gexc network through a reward program. The reward program will be scheduled daily to distribute the pre-defined currency fairly to every eligible user. Using Gexcd is free and the Gexc network is owned by every participant.

This is the repository for Gexclab's Gexc, reference P2P server.
